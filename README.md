Sales Project for Software Development Sprint

In this project, I generated some sample sales data for 2023 from a retailer who sells several different categories of products. The data has 8 different categories per record:

-Order ID - unique order identifier
-Date - a string with the order date
-Product - the product name
-Category - the product category
-Quantity - the number of products purchased in the order
-Price - the price paid for each product
-Total Sales - Quantity * Price

My goal was to build a simple streamlit web app that breaks down this sales data by month and category. I want to make this customizable to filter for month and product category. You can find a scatterplot for each combination of sales and quantity, a histogram for distribution of sales, and a bar chart best used for category comparison.
